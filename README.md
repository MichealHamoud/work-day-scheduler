# work-day-scheduler

this project is a simple work-day schedular that allows the user to input important informtation for the day, which will show the user before hand if the time is in the past (which will be the color grey), present (which will be the color red), and furure (which will be the color green). This also alows the user to save the information for next time and allow him to see it.
